- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rujuta-r-kulkarni
- 👀 I’m interested in **technical writing, technical content creation, and documentation management**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning technical writing through a postgraduate diploma course from Symbiosis. My studies include mastering technical writing foundation as well as tools like Adobe FrameMaker, Content Management Systems, and RoboHelp; understanding various editing languages like  HTML, XML, and CSS; and enhancing my skills in version control systems like Git, and documentation standards.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **technical writing projects, creating technical documentation, user manuals, and guides for software applications**.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on **[LinkedIn](in.linkedin.com/in/rujutarkulkarni)** or **email me at [ruju88ta.k@gmail.com]**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Even though I’m a writer, I sometimes hilariously forget common words or terms (The Paradox of a Writer Who Forgets Words).
